# Web Components guidelines at Clever Cloud

Here a different rules we want any contributor to follow regarding how we write Web Components with LitElement.

## General rules and reminders

* Don't forget to document your component's public API (properties, attributes, methods, events, slots, CSS custom props...)
* Your component should be UI only and NOT COUPLED with where the data comes from
* Don't forget to init your property default values in the constructor
* Use the `dispatchCustomEvent` helper and try to emit your value directly on `detail`
* In the data I/O, prefer array of objects (instead of object literals) for collections
* Always name your event handlers "_onSomething"
* Try to sort your CSS sources in each selector (alphabetically)
* Declare all public properties in the static get properties
* Think about what will happen when there's an error
* Think about what will happen when the data is not there yet, <br/> for this, we use the "skeleton screen" pattern
* Think about what will happen when the data is empty, <br/> don't forget to add a message
* Think about the focus, where does it go when something is validated or when an element disappears
* Use `// language=CSS` over your `css` declaration so WebStorm can to syntaxic coloration and more
* Use `// language=HTML` in your stories so WebStorm can to syntaxic coloration and more
* Try to avoid the quotes for this `prop="${this.prop}"` and do this instead: `prop=${this.prop}`
* Make sure all texts are translated
* Prefix all translation keys with the component name and split parts with dots

## How to order stuff in a custom element using LitElement?

In order to help anyone reading this code base to find what s.he's looking for,
we're proposing this order for the different pars of a custom element built with LitElement:

1. LitElement's properties descriptor <br/> `static get properties () {}`
1. Constructor <br/> `constructor () {}`
1. property getters <br/> `get myProp () {}`
1. property setters <br/> `set myProp (value) {}`
1. public methods <br/> `myMethodName (arg0, arg1) {}`
1. private methods (prefixed with an underscore) <br/> `_myMethodName (arg0, arg1) {}`
1. event handlers (almost always private, prefixed with `_on`) <br/> `_onClickToggle (e) {}`
1. custom element lifecycle callbacks <br/> `connectedCallback () {}`
1. LitElement lifecycle callbacks <br/> `firstUpdated () {}`
1. LitElement's render method <br/> `render () {}`
1. LitElement's styles descriptor <br/> `static get styles () {}`

## How to order attributes when you use a component?

1. `class` attribute
1. other attributes
1. event listeners

## How to document a component?

* Always start a description with an upper case letter and end it with a dot.
* Global component description starts with "A component", "A wrapper", "A helper", "An input", "A form", ...
* Global component description is a simple one-liner.
* Global component description can have a `## Details` section with a bullet list of informations.
* Global component description can have a `## Type definitions` section to document the `type` and `interface` of the properties and events.
* This `## Type definitions` section consists of a group of code samples using the TypeScript definition format.
* Global component description can have a `## Technical details` section for stuffs that don't concern users.
* Global component description can have other sections specific to custom behaviours.
* Properties' descriptions start with a verb at the 3rd person "Sets", "Enables", "Displays", ...
* Events' descriptions start with "Fires whenever..." or "Fires XXX whenever..." when the event passes data.
* Events' type should be `CustomEvent` or `CustomEvent<MyType>` to describe the type of the `detail` property of a custom event.
* Don't forget to set default values for booleans in the constructor.
* Use `@prop` instead of `@attr`.
* Please sort your props and events alphabetically.
* Respect the following order: `@prop`, `@event`, `@slot`, `@cssprop`
* Document methods in place, just above the given method.
* Use a `/** @required */` if component breaks without a given property. Must be in the `static get properties` section.
